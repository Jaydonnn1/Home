  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p> I am a junior majoring in chemical engineering at the University of Edinburgh with a year abroad at UC Berkeley. Research, batteries, global exploration, language learning & intramural rugby is where I enjoy spending my time. This site should serve as a repository for all things in tech I find interesting and travel experienes.  </p>

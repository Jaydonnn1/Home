    <h1>Trip #1!</h1>
    <p>Will be documenting the journey from Cancun to Cartagena here. Massive trip report coming soon!




Getting there: Departing Gatwick for a quick hop to CDG on Easyjet was simple enough. One might be inclined to think that this would be the most uncomfortable 2 hours in the next 4 months but I can asure you otherwise

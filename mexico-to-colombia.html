        <h2>Getting There</h2>
        <p>
            Departing Gatwick for a quick hop to CDG on Easyjet was simple enough. One might be inclined to think that this would be the
            most uncomfortable 2 hours in the next 4 months but I can assure you otherwise. Arriving at CDG on schedule, I had a couple of hours to transfer
            to meet up with my high-school friend and get on the next flight, Aeromexico CDG to MEX on a Boeing 787-9, an aircraft I'd never been on before. Check-in was a faff
            for Aeromexico told me I needed to have an onward journey booked out of Mexico, so it took me an hour of discussing options before I found a website
            to book a bus across the border... in Spanish (a taste of the future). That finished, I sped-ran security and made the plane. Food was awful. Seats okay
            and the 787 almost too quiet. 12 hours later we landed in Mexico city, cleared customs for our connection, and devoured tacos from the first airside
            restaurant we found. We ambled to our next departure gate for our final leg MEX to CAN on Aeromexico. It was a 737-MAX 9 that was pretty new, but our eyes
            indolent now from a lack of sleep, snapped shut as we sat down. 4 hours later we descended into the dreamy beach world of Cancun. Getting out of the
            airport quickly and before I could say the words 'it's too hot', 15 taxi dudes tried to escort us away. We got the bus. And slept and enjoyed 2 nights drinking
            as much of the sweet nectar that Cancun offers in terms of all-inclusive hotels. I'm also realising now I should probably try writing this 'blog' in Spanish for my own practice.

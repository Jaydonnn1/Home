    <h1>Trip #1!</h1>
    <p>Will be documenting the journey from Cancun to Cartagena here. Massive trip report coming soon!




Getting there: Departing Gatwick for a quick hop to CDG on Easyjet was simple enough. One might be inclined to think that this would be the\
most uncomfortable 2 hours in the next 4 months but I can asure you otherwise. Arriving at CDG on schedule, I had a couple of hours to transfer\
to meet up with my high-school friend and get on the next flight, Aeromexico CDG to MEX on a Boeing 787-9, an aircraft I'd never been on before. Check-in was a faf\
for Aeromexico told me I needed to have an onward jounrey booked out of Mexico, so it took me an hour of discussing options before I found a website\
to book a bus across the border ... in Spannish (a taste of the future). That finished, I sped-ran security and made the plane. Food was awful. Seats okay\
and the 787 almost too quiet. 12 hours later we landed in Mexico city, cleared customs for our connection, and devoured tacos from the first airside\
restaurant we found. We ambled to our next departure gate for our final leg MEX to CAN on Aeromexico. It was a 737-MAX 9 that was pretty new, but our eyes\
indolent now from a lack of sleep, snapped shut as we sat down. 4 hours later we descended into the dreamy beach world of Cancun. Getting out of the \
airport quickly and before I could say the words 'it's too hot', 15 taxi dudes tried to escort us away. We got the bus. And slept and enjoyed 2 nights of\
the sweet nectar that Cancun offers in terms of all-inclusive hotels. I'm also realising now I should probably try writing this 'blog' in Spanish for my own practice.
